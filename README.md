## What is Advent of Code

Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, a speed contest, or to challenge each other.
You don't need a computer science background to participate - just a little programming knowledge and some problem solving skills will get you pretty far.

## What this is About

These are selected problems I attempted to solve in advent of code.

Two puzzles will be made available on each day in the Advent calendar; the second puzzle is unlocked when you complete the first. Hence the A and B naming scheme for each day.
Some problems were attempted, but not completed
